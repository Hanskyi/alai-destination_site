      'We believe that involving locals in tourism will alleviate poverty. We train and support locals to make income from tourism. They offer yurt camps, luggage horses, guiding, and taxi services. In 2022, Visit Alay granted 25000 USD to its camp providers to improve the infrastructure of yurt camps. Almost 300 locals got involved in tourism during summer time.',

    description:
      'We want our guests to get the best local experience by staying at homestays and at authentic yurt camps, getting local food, talking to local guides. We see that sometimes travelers travel far from local culture. We want you to stay close to local life and explore the local traditions and customs of Central Asian people.',

By being in a group, you will learn a lot from other fellow travelers. Join one of our groups and leave us with long-lasting memories.',
