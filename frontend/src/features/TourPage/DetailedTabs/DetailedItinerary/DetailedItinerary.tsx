        'After breakfast, we will drive for 30 minutes from Sary Mogul village north to the starting point of the trek. We begin the trek by walking along for about an hour to the first viewpoint. Some parts are a bit challenging as the trail is narrow and the terrain is composed mainly of scree and small pebbles. We will take a break and enjoy the views of the Pamir Mountains from the viewpoint before descending into a valley for lunch. We will break for lunch by a riverbank with glacier views. After lunch, we will head to Sary Mogul Pass at 4,306 meters (1 hour). As you ascend, glaciated peaks and alpine lakes will begin to appear. At the top of the pass, we will see Besh Kol â€“ this viewpoint has stunning views of the alpine lakes and nearby peaks. After descending we will walk down to the campsite at 3,557 meters. Enjoy your dinner under the stars at the yurt camp.',
